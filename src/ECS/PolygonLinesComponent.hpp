    /*
    This component can be used to visualize the polygon shaped objects from a Tiled tilesheet objectgroup.
    It uses the point provided by the tilesheet data to draw lines, as SDL2 is not capable of drawing more complex shapes (other than triangles with SDL_RenderGeometry)
    this is the most sensible way of doing it.
